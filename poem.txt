I loved you once, and still, perhaps, loveâ€™s yearning
Within my soul has not quite burned away.
But may it nevermore you be concerning;
I would not wish you sad in any way.

My love for you was wordless, hopeless cruelly,
Drowned now in shyness, now in jealousy,
And I loved you so tenderly, so truly
As God grant by another you may be.

Alexander Sergeyevich Pushkin,
translation by Julian Henry Lowenfeld


1.
I fear thy kisses, gentle maiden,
Thou needest not fear mine;
My spirit is too deeply laden
Ever to burthen thine.
